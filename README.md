# 3D Object Reconstruction

This ROS Noetic package allows users to compute and visualize 3D reconstructions of objects and environments using the point cloud data from a ZED Stereo Camera. Point cloud feed from the ZED is stitched in real time using odometry from the ZED's positional tracking feature.

This project was completed as part of the course EECS 442: Computer Vision at the University of Michigan.
